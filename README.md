Simple html/js game where you supposed to catch red circle
Not touched since 27-09-2016
- "circles we're simply rounded divs
- score was increased when player "touches" red circle
- score was subtracted when red circle "touched" red boundaries
- As player makes progress circles go faster and after gaining 20 points other circles will change colors
- Final score is based on highest score obtained
- Best score was stored in cookie (if player agreed to that - by clicking "ok" button)
